# Combined-Cycle-Power-Plant
In this project, we aim to build a model to predict the electrical energy output of a Combined Cycle Power Plant. This plant utilizes gas turbines, steam turbines, and heat recovery steam generators to produce power. We will use a dataset containing 9568 hourly average ambient environmental readings from sensors at the power plant for our model.
